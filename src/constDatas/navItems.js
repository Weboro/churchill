Building upon the core units, students can further their project management and service management understanding and capabilities. Facilities management is another unit equipping the students with planning, budgeting, building and maintenance awareness and mastery. The benefits gained in developing research skills will foster job readiness, enabling a more proactive rather than reactive approach to potential opportunities within this changing industry. Unpacking the Major units and based on fostering research skills, students will develop capabilities to reflect and analyse hospitality planning and suitable hospitality management leadership. Through researching case studies and reflecting on observation, students will develop an appreciation of sustainability and environmental issues both of which tend to foster eco-tourism. Working within teams and as independent learners, students appreciate the diversity of teamwork and opportunities within the service/hospitality sector. With such a geographical diversity of registered clubs within NSW and Australia and a thriving service/tourism industry, it is expected unique employment and entrepreneurial opportunities are within the grasp of Churchill graduates. Completing the degree with the Hospitality major one would consider a position as a tourism officer, event manager, bar/ café or restaurant manager or owner, hospitality marketing executive or a hotel or hospitality manager.</p>",

Building on the core units of the Bachelor of Business Degree, the management major extends students' exposure to specialist management functions including human resource management and business finance and engages students with contemporary and emerging issues in the management field. Students undertaking the Management major will gain specialised business knowledge and analytical skills through the study of the critical areas of management that make up the major's units and the subsequent application of this knowledge to real business cases and real business problems. Students will develop the ability to make strategic decisions, to identify the needs of business and society, and they will become informed and collaborative graduates. Graduates of the management major will be equipped with knowledge of how organisations work, with the skills to effectively lead, organise and plan in multiple types of organisations (profit, non-profit, public or private). Graduates of the management major may gain employment in a diversity of roles from general business administration to specialist functional areas building on the knowledge gained through the major's specialist units.</p>",
