            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">International students enrolled in the Bachelor of Business (BBus) course (all majors) are required to complete their course no later than 156 weeks (3 years) from the course commencement date. This requires students to satisfactorily complete (pass) eight (8) units per year to complete the 24 units in three years.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">All students complete four (4) units in semesters 1 and 2 (8 annually). However, students who do not pass eight units annually are required to repeat failed subjects (maximum of 2 units) in semester 3 to maintain their academic progress and complete their course on time, unless they have previously demonstrated compassionate or compelling circumstances or have engaged with the Learning Management Plan (LMP) issued by Churchill Institute.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Based on Standard 8 of the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/esos-framework/national-code-practice-providers-education-and-training-overseas-students-2018" className="text-primary-orange font-semibold underline"> the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training </a> to Overseas Students 2018 (Cth) and Churchill Institute’s Course Progression and Graduation Policy, CoE extensions (changing the course end date to a later date) are only considered based on compassionate or compelling circumstances, or when a student can show they tried to improve their academic performance by completing activities outlined in the LMP.</p>
